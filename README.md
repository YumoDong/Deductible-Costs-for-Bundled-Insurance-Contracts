Software Dependency
===================
The plots/tables were produced under the following software
1. RStudio 1.4.1103
2. Operating system: Windows 10

[Important Notes]:

1. The deductible cost in this paper is calculated by the Monte Carlo simulation method. The time of the simulation process is affected by the number of simulation, so we provide the codes of the Monte Carlo simulation process and also the simulated data sets.
